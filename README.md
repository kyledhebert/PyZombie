# PyZombie
A command-line version of the dice game Zombie Dice

From the command line cd into the PyZombie directory and type:

`$ python3 game.py`

Eat brains. Don't get shotgunned.

You are a zombie. You want braaains. More brains than any of your zombie buddies.

Zombie Dice is fun for any zombie fan (or the whole zombie family). The 13 custom dice are your victims. Push your luck to eat their brains, but stop before the shotgun blasts end your turn!

It's a great quick game. Play it at lunch (braaiiiiiins!) or while you're in line for a zombie movie . . . !
